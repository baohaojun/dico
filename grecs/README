* Introduction

This file contains brief information about using Grecs as a submodule.
You will find a complete documentation for Grecs, in form of man
pages, in the doc/ subdirectory. 

An online copy of the documentation in various formats is available
at http://grecs.man.gnu.org.ua.

If you are interested in libgrecs, a standalone library implementation
of Grecs, see the file README.standalone in this directory, or visit
http://grecs.man.gnu.org.ua.

* Overview

Grecs is a library for parsing structured configuration files from
C programs. A structured configuration file has hierarchical
structure, with block statements enclosing lower-level
statements. Such configurations files are used by many programs, such
as, e.g. Bind or Dico.

Grecs provides primitives for parsing such files into an internal
tree-like structure and for basic operations on such structures. These
operations include value lookups by keyword paths, traversing trees
recursively, joining several trees together, reductions, etc.

* Usage

1. Install grecs as a submodule:

   git submodule add git://git.gnu.org.ua/grecs.git grecs

2. Add a call to GRECS_SETUP to your configure.ac.  It can be as
simple as:

   GRECS_SETUP

If the subproject directory is not 'grecs', supply the actual
directory name as the first argument to this macro, e.g.:

   GRECS_SETUP(lib/grecs)

For a detailed description of the GRECS_SETUP macro, run
`man doc/GRECS_SETUP.3'.

3. In your Makefile.am, add @GRECS_INCLUDES@ to the INCLUDES value,
and @GRECS_LDADD@ to LDADD, e.g.:

   INCLUDES = @GRECS_INCLUDES@
   LDADD = @GRECS_LDADD@
   
4. Include "grecs.h"

5. Use the library to handle your configuration files.  See the
documentation for a detailed discussion.

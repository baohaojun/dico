AT_DATA([input],[My Father had a small Estate in Nottinghamshire; I was the Third of five Sons. He sent me to Emanuel-College in Cambridge, at Fourteen Years old, where I resided three Years, and applyed my self close to my Studies: But the Charge of maintaining me (although I had a very scanty Allowance) being too great for a narrow Fortune; I was bound Apprentice to Mr. James Bates, an eminent Surgeon in London, with whom I continued four Years; and my Father now and then sending me small Sums of Money,  I laid them out in learning Navigation, and other parts of the Mathematicks, useful to those who intend to travel, as I always believed it would be some time or other my Fortune to do. When I left Mr. Bates, I went down to my Father; where, by the Assistance of him and my Uncle John, and some other Relations, I got Forty Pounds, and a Promise of Thirty Pounds a Year to maintain me at Leyden: There I studied Physick two Years and seven Months, knowing it would be useful in long Voyages.

Soon after my Return from Leyden, I was recommended, by my good
Master Mr. Bates, to be Surgeon to the Swallow, Captain Abraham Pannell
Commander; with whom I continued three Years and a half, making a
Voyage or two into the Levant, and some other Parts. When I came back, I
resolved to settle in London, to which Mr. Bates, my Master, encouraged
me, and by him I was recommended to several Patients. I took Part of a
small House in the Old Jury; and being advised to alter my Condition, I
married Mrs. Mary Burton, second Daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton,
Hosier, in Newgate-street, with whom I received four Hundred Pounds for
a Portion.

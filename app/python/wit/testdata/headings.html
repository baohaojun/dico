<h1> Section headings </h1>
<i>Headings</i> organize your writing into
sections. The Wiki software can automatically
generate a <a href="http://pl.wiktionary.org/table%20of%20contents">table of contents</a> from them.

<h2> Subsection </h2>Using more "equals" (=) signs creates a subsection.

<h3> A smaller subsection </h3>
Don't skip levels,
like from two to four equals signs.

Start with 2 equals signs not 1
because 1 creates H1 tags
which should be reserved for page title.

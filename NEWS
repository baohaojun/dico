Version 2.2, 2012-03-04

* Configuration changes

** load-module

The load-module form allows for a statement use, e.g.:

  load-module word;

The above statement is equivalent to:  

  load-module word {
     command "word";
  }

Either string or list of strings is accepted as argument.  The latter
is useful for loading several modules with a single statement, e.g.:

  load-module (stratall,substr,word);
  
* New modules

** gcide

This module provides support for GNU Collaborative International
Dictionary of English.

** wordnet

This module provides support for WordNet, a lexical database for the
English language developed in the Princeton University and distributed
under a BSD style license.

** word

This module provides the following strategies:

word "Match separate words within headwords"
first "Match the first word within headwords"
last "Match the last word within headwords"

** nprefix

Provides the nprefix strategy.  It is similar to prefix but returns the
specified range of matches.  For example

   MATCH <dict> nprefix <skip>#<count>#<string>

returns at most <count> headwords whose prefix matches <string>,
skipping first <skip> unique matches.

** pcre

Provides matching strategy based on Perl regular expressions.

** pam

Implements PAM authentication.

* New utility: gcider 

"Gcider" is a window-based application for browsing the GNU
Collaborative International Dictionary of English (see
http://www.gnu.org/software/gcide).


Version 2.1, 2010-07-07

* Normalize exit codes.

The dicod server uses exit codes from sysexits.h.

* Replies to MATCH command.

The dictorg backend filters out duplicate entries from MATCH replies.
Only the first one from a sequence of such duplicates is retained.

* New configuration statements.

** prepend-load-path

Acts much the same as module-load-path, but adds directories at front
of the default Dico module directory.

* Strategies

** All

The `all' strategy has been re-implemented as a loadable module.  To
enable this strategy in daemon, load the `stratall' module:

load-module stratall {
	command "stratall";
}

** Substr

New strategy `substr' matches a substring anywhere in the headword.
To enable this strategy, load the `substr' module:

load-module substr {
	command "substr";
}

* LDAP

Dicod now supports LDAP as an underlying mechanism for storing
user databases.  The LDAP support is loaded as a module:

load-module ldap {
	command "ldap";
}

See the documentation, subsection 3.3.3.2 "LDAP Databases", for
a detailed description.

* Dicoweb

Improved handling of databases without a descriptive name (previous
version would throw exception for such cases).

The file settings.py renamed to settings-sample.py.

The file static/opensearch.xml has been moved to templates.  If
you are upgrading from an earlier version, you may safely remove it.

* Bugfixes:
** Fixed improper handling of conversion errors in levenshtein.c
(debian #582692)
** Removed the use of fixed-size buffer in dictorg.c (fixes debian
#582708)

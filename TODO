Dico TODO list.


* Streams

Drop stream functions from lib and import the stream library from Mailutils.
It sprang off from Dico a couple of years ago and evolved into a pretty 
mature system.

* Documentation.
** Add a pointer to ellinika.gnu.org.ua:dict.

* A module for kanjidic/edict.

* X client for the above.

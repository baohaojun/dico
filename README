GNU Dico README
Copyright (C) 2008-2010, 2012 Sergey Poznyakoff

* Introduction
==============

This file contains brief information about configuring, testing
and running GNU Dico.  It is *not* intended as a replacement
for the documentation, but is provided as a brief reference only.
The complete documentation for Dico is available in doc/
subdirectory. To read it without installing the package run
`info -f doc/dico.info'. After the package is installed the
documentation can be accessed running `info Dico'.  Invoking
`info dico' and `info dicod' (with a lower-case `d') will show you a 
concise description of the command line syntax (similar to a man-page
style) of `dico' and `dicod' programs, correspondingly.

An online copy of the documentation in various formats is available
at http://dico.man.gnu.org.ua.

* Overview
==========

Dico is a flexible implementation of DICT server (RFC 2229).  The
server is modular: the daemon itself (dicod) provides only the server
functionality, and knows nothing about database formats.  Actual
searches are performed by functions supplied in loadable modules.  A
single module can handle any number of database instances. 

The package includes several modules for searching in different
dictionary databases, such as dict.org, WordNet and others.

The server can be configured to handle both anonymous and authorized
access.  It supports a wide variety of authentication algorithms.
Simpler configurations can keep the user database in plaintext files,
while more complex ones can use LDAP.

A console client program, `dico', is included.

A module for lookups in Jim Breen's Kanjidic and Edict databases will
be added in future.

* What's in a name?
===================

Dico is informal French for "Dictionary".  It is pronounced "Deekoh",
with the stress on the last syllable.

* Modules
=========

The package comes with the following modules:

- dictorg
  This module handles databases in dict.org format.

- outline
  Support for databases in Emacs outline format. This module is
  designed mostly as an example and for testing purposes.

- gcide
  GNUCIDE dictionary support.

- wordnet
  WordNet support.  WordNet is a lexical database for the English
  language, created and maintained at the Cognitive Science Laboratory
  of Princeton University.
  
- guile
  An abstract layer for interfacing with database modules written in
  Guile.

- python
  An abstract layer for interfacing with database modules written in
  Python.
 
- substr
  Defines the "substr" lookup strategy, which matches a supplied
  substring anywhere in the headword.

- stratall
  Defines a special lookup strategy, named "all", which returns all
  headwords from the database.

- word
  Defines the "word" lookup strategy, which matches a supplied
  word anywhere in the headword.

- pcre
  Defines a strategy for using Perl-compatible regular expressions.
  
- ldap
  Brings support for LDAP user databases.

- pam
  Implements PAM authentication.
  
* Building
==========

As usual:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ make install
 
See INSTALL for the generic configure instructions.  The rest of this
section describes configuration options and variables specific for
Dico.

** Default Preprocessor
------------------------

The runtime configuration system uses `m4' to preprocess the
configuration file, which makes the configuration extremely flexible.
We recommend to use GNU m4 as a preprocessor, although any other
implementation of `m4' can be used as well.  The `configure' script tries to
determine the full file name of the preprocessor binary and the necessary
command line options.  In case it makes a wrong guess, you can instruct
it to use a particular preprocessor by defining the `DEFAULT_PREPROCESSOR'
configuration variable.  For example, the following `configure'
invocation instructs it to use `/usr/local/bin/gm4':

     $ ./configure DEFAULT_PREPROCESSOR="/usr/local/bin/gm4 -s"

Note the use of the `-s' preprocessor option.  It tells `m4' to
produce line directives which help `dicod' produce correct diagnostics
about eventual configuration errors.  Unless your `m4' implementation
does not have this feature, we recommend to always use it in
`DEFAULT_PREPROCESSOR' value.

   Finally, if you do not wish to use preprocessor at all, use
the `--without-preprocessor' option.

** Default Server
-----------------

Unless given an explicit dictionary server, the client program `dico'
attempts to connect the server `dict://dico.gnu.org.ua'.  You can
change this default by setting the DEFAULT_DICT_SERVER environment
variable to the desired server hostname.  For example:

     $ ./configure DEFAULT_DICT_SERVER=dict.org


** Guile Support
-----------------

The "GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions" (Guile)
can be used to write database modules for `dico'.  This
requires Guile version 1.8.4 or newer.  The `configure' script will
probe for the presence of Guile on your system and automatically enable
its use if its version number is high enough.

If you do not wish to use Guile, use `--without-guile' to disable it.

** WordNet database
-------------------

If you plan to use WordNet database, you will most probably need the
`--with-wordnet' option to inform the script about the location where
WordNet libraries and headers can be found.  For example, the command

  ./configure --with-wordnet=/usr/local/WordNet-3.0

instructs the script to look for WordNet library files in
/usr/local/WordNet-3.0/lib and for include files in
/usr/local/WordNet-3.0/include.

** Other Configure Settings
----------------------------

The `dicod' daemon uses syslog for diagnostics.  The default syslog
facility can be set using `LOG_FACILITY' configuration variable.  
Allowed arguments are `user', `daemon', `auth', `authpriv', `mail',
`cron', and `local0' through `local7' (case insensitive).

By default, the `daemon' facility is used.
